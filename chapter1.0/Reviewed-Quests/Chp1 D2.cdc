1. What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars? 
Safety and Security, Clarity, Approchability, Developer Experience and Resource Oriented Programming

2. In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?

Safety and Security : With the Cadence type system, a contract / transaction has to be "safe and secure" to be able to deploy / execute successfully on chain.

Clarity : The higher clarity the programming langauge is, the easier for verifier / users to verify the code.

Approachability : People with ideas can develop their Dapps on their own and focus on the functionality without going to professional developers. 

Developer Experience : Debuggin would become easier and more developers would like to onboard.
